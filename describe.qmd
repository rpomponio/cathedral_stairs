```{r}
library(data.table)
reps <- fread(file.path("Data/MtnSchoolStairReps.csv"))
```
Convert rep times to pace in meters per hour:

```{r}
reps[, PaceMPH:=60 * 132 / TimeMins]
hist(reps[, PaceMPH], xlab="Meters per hour", main="Histogram")
```
Next steps: describe variability in pace due to influence of fatigue, load, and inter-student heterogeneity.
